        Our values (along with many of our characteristics as a business) are sometimes very different from most motoring solicitors whose advice often conflicts with our own, most likely due to a lack of specialism and knowledge of the strategies we apply. We always act with the highest level of integrity applying fundamental legal and professional principles to the work we do. The fact that we are so successful often leads to our clients providing glowing feedback about our services on this website and the well-known review site, Trustpilot. As a client of our firm, you can be assured that if ever a court or the crown seeks to circumvent the law to deprive you of a fair trial, hearing or to unfairly attack you we will always fight back for justice to be achieved.
High Court Cases
Our High Court cases are worthy of review as published commentary of some of the headway we have made in redressing the balance for our clients over recent years. The following judgments from a handful of our cases that can be read in full by clicking on the badge, demonstrate our unending determination to comply with the law whilst also working in our clients’ best interests, whether this be to achieve a Not Guilty verdict, a lesser offence to be substituted, or persuading the court to impose a lenient penalty.

            This case involved an adjournment at trial that should never have been granted. It was challenged due to the apparent unfairness of the decision and reasoning given by the court. The High Court agreed with us and our client was acquitted as a result… Read More

            This case was taken to the High Court after the District Judge who was involved in managing the case made numerous decisions that were plainly unfair and compromised our client’s ability to have a fair trial. The eventual trial that took place was directed to be heard by an alternative judge as it would seem, the High Court agreed with our own concerns about the conduct of the District Judge whose decision we challenged. This client was also cleared of the charge and a Not Guilty verdict secured… Read More        </div>

            Rather than focus on your motoring offence problems, we find solutions. You may not feel like it is possible to unravel the situation you are in right now, but the expert motoring law team at Geoffrey Miller Solicitors are often able to apply unique case strategies to our cases that achieve near miraculous results. Many clients often receive conflicting advice to the guidance we offer and so we have worked hard to ensure we have hard facts and statistics to back up our claims of success. You may be looking into the possibility of changing solicitors, in which case, please contact us as a priority.
            When we achieve the right result for our clients, there tends to be an overwhelming desire to help other people facing a similar fate to them and it is this that led to our unique interactive testimonial service, “Ask Our Clients.” In addition to wanting to shout about their case results to other people in the same boat as they once were, our clients often describe a feeling of elation when their case is successfully concluded. To see this feeling of relief our clients frequently feel captured on live footage, take a look at the video recorded of Mr. Brian Wiltshire leaving court after our lawyers successfully appealed against his speeding ticket. If you want to feel like Brian did, give us a call on Freephone 0800 1389 123 and we will discuss your driving defence options free of charge.
            FREE MOTORING “TELEPHONE TRIAGE” SERVICE
            We offer a free “Telephone Triage” service where we are able to consider the charges you face, assess your concerns, and outline the options available to you. There is no charge for our input pursuant to this service where you will be able to speak to a member of our legal team who will spend the time to establish your objectives and tailor the advice to suit you. Many clients have provided extremely positive feedback to us after this early stage of the process. Often callers say that they wish they had not left it so long before contacting us about their case. Sometimes, the anxiety about what may happen to you without an expert motoring solicitor’s input can make the mind wander and all manner of extreme scenarios can be anticipated. In reality, we are likely to be able to outline a clear plan of action that avoids or significantly reduces the consequences you may be fearing.
            FREE MOTORING LAW INFORMATION
            We have included many unique features on our website as we believe that providing free information to prospective clients enables you to understand the full consequences of the charge(s) you face and whether or not you need to engage expert motoring law solicitors to help you. Whether you are faced with a drunk driving charge or a speeding offence we urge you to take a look at the following pages:
            Unique Interactive Testimonial Service – You can get in touch with clients we have represented for an independent review of our services.
            Our TrustPilot Profile – Whilst we have hundreds of clients who have left glowing reviews on this site, we also want you to be able to verify our performance through an externally operated and trusted medium.
            Our Results – We publish data about our case results on an annual basis so you can see how we fare on cases similar to your motoring case.
            Professional Consequences of a Drink Driving Conviction – check out how your regulators will view a conviction.
            Drink Driving Rehabilitation Course – we explain the nature of the course and how it will reduce the drink drive disqualification you face.
            Common Questions – If you are looking for answers to questions about a drunk driving offence, we think we have listed the most common concerns along with our explanations here. If you are looking for the answer to a specific query you are likely to find it on this site by using the search tool.
            Submit Your Case – We are happy to review initial papers in a case (without charge) and discuss your options with you.
            Browse away on our site by all means but nothing beats speaking to a lawyer at the firm. Many people who get in touch with us report feeling immediate relief once they have spoken to us about their options.
